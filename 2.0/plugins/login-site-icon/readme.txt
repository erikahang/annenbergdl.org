== Description ==
Login site icon is a simple way to brand your site's WordPress login screen. Rather than the WordPress mark, linked to WordPress.org, the site icon is used and linked to the site's home page. The site icon is used rather than the logo theme feature because it is already a square image, and the login screen is designed to use a square image here. If you already have a site icon set up, this plugin will work automatically as soon as it's activated.

Re-branding the login screen slightly can reduce confusion for users that have (or use) multiple WordPress sites, as well as improving contributor understanding for sites with a large number of contributors. Note that site icons must be square and that their primary purpose is to be used as browser and device icons. However, this plugin provides a convenient way to make use of the icon in another context.

1. Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
